# Foods and Fashion

This is some code that I wrote while trying to accommodate myself with Rails concepts such as relational data and the MVC model. Please note that this code is not meant to be run as-is.

More recent demonstrations of my use of Rails include the repos [Mr. Messenger](https://github.com/risafj/mr_messenger) and [Board Game Club](https://github.com/risafj/board_game_club).
